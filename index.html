        <h2>Who I am...</h2>
        <p><em>Marketing Manager and aspiring Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>I am passionately curious…
          <br>
          Passionately curious about all things marketing, that is…Anything that directly or indirectly fits into marketing, from traditional marketing to contemporary marketing tools to digital marketing and coding and so much more. This drives me
          to feed my curiosity and keep learning continuously.
          <br>
          Being part of the team that launched Marriott Bonvoy to the world was an incredible experience. Seeing 3 incredible loyalty programmes merge into one and seeing how so many different pieces of the puzzle fit together and have astonishing
          results have been a great learning experience. Working on events, projects, and activations, and growth initiatives like this are what drives my passion for Marketing. Not just the creativity of it, but every aspect.
          <br>
          Having started my studies with Tourism and Marketing, I quickly realised that my passion was in Marketing.
          I started working at the University of Pretoria, where I was part of the team that conceptualised and executed the university's new brand identity and voice. Then I had the incredible opportunity to be part of the opening team for a unique
          and quirky hotel in the market, Protea Hotel Fire & Ice! Menlyn. We then successfully launched Marriott Bonvoy across the Middle East & Africa. Each of these projects is something to be genuinely proud of.
